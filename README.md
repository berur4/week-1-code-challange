# Grade Assignment Program

This JavaScript program allows users to input students' names and marks to assign corresponding grades based on a defined grading scale. After each mark is entered, the program outputs the student's grade, making it a straightforward tool for grading management.

## Usage

1. Run the program using Node.js.
2. Enter each student's name and mark when prompted.
3. To end the input process and view all results, type "done."

## Example

```javascript
// Sample output for student entry
Enter student's name (or type 'done' to finish):
Caleb
Enter the student's mark (0 - 100):
85
// Output: "Grade for Caleb: A"

# Speed Check Program

This JavaScript program, `checkSpeed`, helps monitor and evaluate driver speed compliance. Based on a given speed, it calculates demerit points and provides feedback according to specific speed thresholds. This tool is useful for tracking whether a driver is within the speed limit, accruing points, or eligible for license suspension.
